# This file is a dejagnu "board file" and is used to run the testsuite
# with OMP-OFFLOAD support on a CPU device.
#
# Example usage for CPU offload:
# $ make check RUNTESTFLAGS='--target_board=openmp-cpu-cpp' TESTS="gdb.openmp/*.exp"

# This is copied from baseboards/unix.exp.
# At the moment this only supports things that unix.exp supports.
