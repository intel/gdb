# Tests GDBs support for SYCL, for stepping inside a parallel_for
# kernel after deleting a BP.  This case is interesting because when
# there are no breakpoints and we do stepping while the
# scheduler-locking setting is off, GDB sends a combined vCont
# package, such as "vCont;r0xff10,0xffa0:p1.9;c", which means "make
# thread 1.9 do range-stepping from 0xff10 to 0xffa0, while continuing
# others."  We test the target's ability to handle such a resume
# request.
